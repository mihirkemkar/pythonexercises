#In this task, you will be performing some mathematical calculations with the help of operators. You are given two numbers x = 15 and y = 4.
x = 16
y = 4

#print(type(x))
#print(type(y))

# Perform Addition and save it to addition variable.

addition = x + y
print("Addtion is :", addition)

# Perform subtraction and save it to the subtraction variable

subtraction = x - y
print("Subtraction is :", subtraction)

# Perform multiplication and save it to the multiplication variable

multiplication = x * y
print("Multiplication is :", multiplication)

# Perform division and save it to the division variable
division = x / y
print("Division is :", division)

# Perform integer_division and save it to the integer_division variable

integer_division = x // y
print("Integer Division is :", integer_division)

# Perform exponentiation and save it to the exponent variable

exponent = x**y
print("Exponentiation is :", exponent)
